# golang-toolkit

Library with no dependencies containing useful little bits of go code

This library is under heavy development at the moment as I'm using it for
another project I'm working on. I plan to update with an official release
once I've gotten all the functionality working. It's currently a hodgepodge
of code that I copied and pasted from a couple of different internal repos.

It's ugly and there's big blocks commented out at the moment, however more
is on the way.

# Tools
Like any toolkit, there's multiple tools in here.

## calls
Functions for building functions, mostly error and signal handling helpers.

## clients
Library of functions to support (currently only) HTTP-based clients.

## objects
Useful functions when dealing with "objects", or interfaces basically.

## servers
Library of functions to support (currently only) HTTP-based servers.

# License
See <a href="LICENSE">LICENSE</a> for more information but, it's Apache 2.0.

# Contributing
You're welcome to make pull requests, issues, or anything else, however beware
since I'm actively developing at the moment, it's probably going to change a
lot in the short term.
